      Keith Stratton is a Canadian composer and percussionist currently based in Montréal, Québec. Hailing from Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, he completed his Bachelor of Music degree at Acadia University in 2016, where he did a double stream in composition and percussion performance. He is currently completing his Master’s degree at McGill University, where he studies with Jean Lesage and is currently composer-in-residence with the percussion ensemble.

      Keith’s musical career began in Charlottetown where he performed regularly as a jazz and rock drummer. As a teenager he became enchanted with the music of Frank Zappa and became interested in classical percussion after performing with the PEI Honours Band in 2011. The following year he began studying composition at Acadia University with esteemed Canadian composers Derek Charke and Peter Togni, as well as percussion performance with Mark Adam. During his time at Acadia, he wrote for a diverse array of the school’s groups, including the wind ensemble, sax quartet, and percussion ensemble.

      Since moving to Montreal in 2016, Keith’s music has been performed by rising artists such as mezzo-soprano Simone McIntosh, Groupe le Vivier, and the new music collective Ear Camera, of which he is a performing member. At McGill he has been highly active as a composer, performer and concert organizer.

      In addition to music, Keith has a passion for post-modern film, literature and cultural theory, all of which he seeks to incorporate into his compositional style. A primary artistic pursuit is the growing prominence of the internet in Western culture, and its fragmentary effect on human identity. Influences such as Mauricio Kagel, John Zorn and Ween point him towards an almost transcendent level of hyper-referencing - a “granular polystylism”.
